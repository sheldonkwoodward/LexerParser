# CPTR245: Lab 2 - Tools

The lab this week focuses on using tools to improve your code quality.
You must use three types of tools: Continuous Integration, Code Quality, and Code Review.
[GitHub](http://www.github.com)  has many services that integrate directly with their system that cover these areas.
[GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) lists out all services that are ready to be added as a service on GitHub.


## Resources
 * [github](https://github.com) hosted git repos
 * [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) complete list of servcies
 * [Lab 2](https://github.com/prestoncarman/wwu_cptr245_lab2) description


## Objectives
The objectives for this lab are for students to:

1. Configure and integrate a continuous integration server into your project.
1. Integrate a code coverage service and demonstrate increasing test coverage.
1. Integrate a code review tool and improving code from the report.


## Suggested Tools
Many tools exist to perform these takes, please use one of the following:

__Continuous Integration__ (Choose One)
* Travis CI
* CircleCI

__Code Quality and Code Review__ (Choose Two)
* Codacy
* Codecov
* Code Climate
* Coveralls

Choose two services from the __Code Quality and Code Review__ category.
Choose one service to report test coverage over your project.
Choose a second service to review the code suggest improvements.
While you may find this can be done in one service, pick two so you can see how they may differ.

If you have a alternate tool not on the list, you must get prior approval to use it.


## Project Selection
You may choose your own project to set up these services.

* The project must not have these services already configured.
* The project must have xUnit testing. (You may add it as part of this lab.)
* The project must be large enough for these services to report issues.
* Please talk to the instructor before making your project selection.

## Criteria
The following things will be looked for when grading the assignment:

1. A status of the project before the services were added (description, # of tests, etc.).
1. Screen shots documenting these services are configured for the project.
1. Test code used to improve the test coverage (at least ten new tests).
1. Code changes based on the code review tool (at least ten quality improvements).
1. Report showing before and after for the above code changes.
